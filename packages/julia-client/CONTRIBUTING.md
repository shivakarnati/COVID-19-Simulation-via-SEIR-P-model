# Contributing to Atom-Julia

Julia support in Atom is in a very, very early state – we love to have people kicking the
tires, but be ready to get your hands dirty!

## Help & Bug Reporting

This project is composed of many sub-projects, and it can be hard to know the appropriate
place to file issues. For that reason we prefer that non-developers report issues on the
[Julia discussion forum](https://discourse.julialang.org) under the "usage" category with "juno" tag, and we can 
funnel things through to the right places from there.

## Contributing

If you have feature ideas you'd like to implement, or bugs you'd like to fix, feel free to
open a [discussion](https://discourse.julialang.org) under the "development" category with "juno" tag – we're always happy 
to help people flesh out their ideas or get unstuck on problems.

If you look over the GitHub issues for the various packages, you may notice some labelled
[up for
grabs](https://github.com/JunoLab/atom-julia-client/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22up+for+grabs%22).
These are features or bugs for which the implementation or fix is reasonably straightforward –
they might take a few hours of effort or more, but they won't involve enormous expert-level
challenges. As above, feel free to open up a discussion on these and we'll help you get
going.

Please read the [developer set up guidelines](docs/) to get started. There's a basic
development tutorial there, but as you get deeper you'll want some more general resources:

* [Julia Documentation](http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/) – for learning about the Julia
  language.
* [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) – by far the best reference
  on the JavaScript language and browser window APIs.
* [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) – Atom and its packages use this to make working
  with JS a little more convenient.
* [The Atom Docs](https://atom.io/docs) – the Atom Flight Manual is a very readable introduction
  to Atom's internals, and the API docs are a useful reference.
* [julia-client developer docs](docs/) – These docs go into more detail about the internals
  of this project and the development workflow.

Most open source projects, including ours, use [git](http://git-scm.org) to help work
together. There are plenty of git tutorials around, and the various GUI clients (e.g. GitHub
for Windows/Mac, SourceTree) are very helpful for learning the ropes.
